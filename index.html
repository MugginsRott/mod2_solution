                This is the beef menu! Oh boy is this menu a real treat. We got all your favorites like classic Ground beef! In this dish we take some beef and grind it on up. Pretty self explainatory i guess. Really I am only typing this paragraph to ger some practice typing.

					<h2><h2>Sushi</h2>

				Now Sushi is something we can all get behind! I mean come on who in their right minds doesn't like Sushi? I personally love the stuff although I will admit sometimes it does seem pretty exppensive for what you get! All that being said it is still my fave.
